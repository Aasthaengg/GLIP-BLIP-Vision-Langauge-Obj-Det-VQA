## About GLIP: Grounded Language-Image Pre-training - 
> GLIP demonstrate strong zero-shot and few-shot transferability to various object-level recognition tasks.

> The model used in this repo is GLIP-T, it is originally pre-trained on Conceptual Captions 3M and SBU captions.

<br />

## About BLIP: Bootstrapping Language-Image Pre-training for Unified Vision-Language Understanding and Generation - 

> A new model architecture that enables a wider range of downstream tasks than existing methods, and a new dataset bootstrapping method for learning from noisy web data.

## Installation and Setup

***Enviornment*** - Due to limitations with `maskrcnn_benchmark`, this repo requires Pytorch=1.10 and torchvision.

Use `requirements.txt` to install dependencies

```sh
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
Build `maskrcnn_benchmark`
```
python setup.py build develop --user
```

To verify a successful build, check the terminal for message  
"Finished processing dependencies for maskrcnn-benchmark==0.1"

## Checkpoints

> Download the pre-trained models into the `checkpoints` folder.

<br />

```sh
mkdir checkpoints
cd checkpoints
```

## If you have an NVIDIA GPU with 8GB VRAM, run local demo using Gradio interface

```sh
python3 app_local.py
```

## Sample display
</br>

> After loading the checkpoints, you must click on the prompted local URL to run inference.
